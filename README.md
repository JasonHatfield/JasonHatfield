## Background

âš“ Before entering the field of software engineering, I served as a [Helicopter Rescue Swimmer](https://www.navy.com/careers/aviation-rescue-swimmer) in the United States Navy. That experience developed my resilience, attention to detail, and capacity to perform in high-pressure environmentsâ€”qualities I now apply to engineering complex systems and collaborating with development teams.
